# üß† Brain Tumor MRI Classifier (MobileNetV2)

## üöÄ Overview
This project is a deep learning classifier deployed using **Streamlit** that analyzes brain MRI scans to classify them into four categories: **Glioma Tumor**, **Meningioma Tumor**, **Pituitary Tumor**, or **No Tumor**.

The model was built using Transfer Learning with the **MobileNetV2** architecture and achieved a validation accuracy of over 90%.
